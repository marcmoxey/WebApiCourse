Overall idea
A ToDo API that cpture a list of ToDos person. It wil give your your list, give you indivdual todos, you can update a todo, insert a new one, or delete a todo. We probably want a seprate endpoint for marking a todo as complete 


ToDo:
Id
Task - "Take put the garbage", "Write that term paper"
AssignedTo - The Id of the User 
IsCompleted - boolean 

User: 
Id
FirstName
LastName 
UserName



API Endpoint Design: 

GET: /Todos - Get all Todos
GET: /Todos/{id} - Get a specific todo
POST: /Todos - Create a new todo
PUT: /Todos/{id} - Update a todo's task information 
DELETE: /Todos/{id} - Delete a todo 
PUT: /Todos/{id}/Complete - Mark the todo as complete
